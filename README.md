# E-Learning
E-Learning Facility - n-tier web application

The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic data-driven web application written in ASP.NET and C#. The main focus is on persistent state, access control, ADO.NET database operations, validation and AJAX. Another important feature is that the web application has an underlying n-tier architecture, and utilises principles of abstraction, decomposition and modularisation.
